If such a claim is made or appears likely to be made, Customer agrees to permit IBM to enable Customer to continue to use the Materials or Base Components, or to modify them, or replace them with non-infringing Materials or Base Components that are at least functionally equivalent. If IBM determines that none of these alternatives is reasonably available, Customer agrees to return the Materials or Base Components (if in Customer\\'s possession) to IBM on IBM\\'s written request.

For indemnification under this Section 8.2, IBM will:\\n\\n 1. promptly notify Customer in writing of the claim; and\\n\\n 2. allow Customer to control, and will cooperate with Customer in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.\\n\\nc. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, Customer shall be relieved of its indemnification duty or obligation to the extent that IBM\\'s bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. breach of its contractual obligations hereunder is a cause of the damages suffered by the Services Recipient.\\n\\n 9.0 Limitation of Liability\\n\\n9.1 IBM\\'s Limitation of Liability\\n\\nCircumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM\\'s part or other liability, Customer is entitled to recover damages from IBM.

The foregoing limit also applies to any of IBM\\'s Affiliates and Subcontractors. It is the cumulative maximum for which IBM and its Affiliates and Subcontractors are collectively responsible. Under no circumstances is IBM, its Affiliates or its Subcontractors liable for any of the following:\\n\\n 1. third party claims against Customer for damages (other than those expressly provided in Subsections 9.1(a) and 9.1(b)); or\\n\\n 2. loss of, or damage to, Customer\\'s or any other entity\\'s records or data.\\n\\n9.2 Customer\\'s Limitation of Liability\\n\\nCircumstances may arise where, because of a default on Customer\\'s part or other liability, IBM is entitled to recover damages from Customer.

If IBM reasonably determines that a breach of any such warranty has occurred, then IBM may, in its sole and reasonable discretion:\\n\\na. restrict Customer\\'s access to the Services;\\n\\nb. remove or require removal of any offending Content;\\n\\nc. terminate this Agreement for cause; and/or\\n\\nd. exercise other rights and remedies, at law or in equity.\\n\\nExcept in an emergency or as may otherwise be required by law, before undertaking the activities in Subsection 11.3(a) or 11.3(b), IBM will attempt to notify Customer by any reasonably practical means under the circumstances, such as, without limitation, by telephone or e-mail.\\n\\nCustomer will promptly notify IBM of any event or circumstance related to this Agreement, Customer\\'s use of the Services, or Content of which Customer becomes aware that could lead to a claim or demand against IBM, and Customer will provide all relevant information relating to such event or circumstance to IBM at IBM\\'s request.\\n\\n11.4 Required Consents\\n\\nCustomer will promptly obtain and upon request provide to IBM evidence of such Required Consents necessary for IBM to provide the Services.

Unless otherwise specified in an SOA, such maintenance excludes upgrades to Base Components. Call back response times for Base Component failures through issue resolution is designated in the relevant Service Option Attachment.\\n\\n12.3 No Sale or Lease of Goods\\n\\nAs between Customer and IBM, IBM retains all right, title and interest in the Base Components. No goods are sold or leased by IBM under this Agreement. If Customer desires to purchase or to lease goods from IBM, such purchase or lease will be governed by a separate mutually acceptable written agreement between Customer and IBM or an IBM Affiliate.\\n\\n12.4 No Lease of Real Property\\n\\nThis Agreement is a services agreement and not a lease of any real property.\\n\\n 13.0 Changes\\n\\n13.1 Services\\n\\nIBM, in its reasonable discretion, may change the terms and conditions of Attachment A and/or Service Option Attachments, upon at least ninety (90) days prior notice to Customer.

Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing will be void. In any permitted assignment, Customer will remain liable for its obligations hereunder.\\n\\n14.11 No Resale\\n\\nCustomer shall not resell the Services, in whole or in part.\\n\\n14.12 Risk of Loss\\n\\nRisk of loss for all Base Components shall at all times remain with IBM.
